# Minecraft

6th Assignment for Appleseed's Academy Coding Bootcamp (Week 6).

In the assignment, we created a 2D world version of Minecraft.

In our version, we created a game that allows the player to select one of three tools and use it only in the relevant area, for example shovel for digging the land.
In this game, you can accumulate pieces from any part you cut.
The game is random so it will change positions in every click on a new game button.

The assignment is based on the following subjects:

* collaboration on GitHub
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
